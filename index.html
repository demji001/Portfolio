            <p>Finding out the underlying reasons why things are the way they are now, from why the planets are where and how they are today to why it works when I type something into Google, has always held a certain fascination for me.</p>
            <p>I have experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as Java. I started coding in Python in 8th grade when my mom signed me up for a semester online coding camp. I didn't enjoy that very much, but when I got to high schoo,, in sophomore year, I signed up for Computer Science I and we did cool projects. After that, I was more interested in Computer Science and took AP Computer Science and did Nextech Catapult after that.</p>
            <p>My main hobbies are hanging out with my friends, playing games, and reading. So that's the things I enjoy the most. My favorite sport is tennis, although I can find enjoyment playing all sports for the most part -- however, watching most sports is extremely boring to me. I like animals, and have a pet dog, but I like cats a lot as well. My favorite genre of music is rock music, though I don't listen to music too much.</p>
            <p>I go to Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in northern Indianapolis, and am a Senior there as of 2025. I am involved in the Robotics Club and the Coding Club and have played tennis during the season every single year for Brebeuf since I started going. I also have done track and field every year in the spring season, which is when the tennis season has ended. I joined Robotics nearing the end of my freshman year, because a lot of my friends were in it. That's one of the main reasons I'm still in it, but I do also enjoy building the robot and I'm not too shabby at the coding portion of robotics (we do VEX V5). I'll admit that I'm not very good at any sports (at least right now), but I do really enjoy tennis especially.</p>
            <p>Something about this website - I also made a design for something that I was originally going to make into my portfolio website, but it became too complicated. However, it is still incorporated in here in hidden parts, if you can find it.</p>
